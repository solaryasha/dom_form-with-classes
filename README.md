# Form with Classes

Implement the classes `Input`, `EmailInput`, `PhoneInput`, and `Form` so that the code in `main.js` works. You should modify `input.js`, `email-input.js`, `phone-input.js`, and `form.js` respectively. You must not modify `main.js` or `index.html`.

The scripts should display a form with four fields and a submit button on the page. When the user correctly enters all the data and hits the button, the data should be printed to the console (see lines 22-27 in `main.js`). Otherwise (if the name or email is not specified, or either the email or phone is not in the correct format) it should instead print the name of the field with the invalid input (see lines 29-31).
